# PRODIGY_GA_05
This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) to combine the artistic style of one image (for example, a famous painting) with the content of another image (such as a photograph). The result is a new image that retains the content of the original photo but appears as if it were painted in the chosen artistic style.
